I am a post-doctoral researcher in the [Applied Mathematics department (UMA)](https://uma.ensta-paris.fr/) of [ENSTA Paris](https://www.ensta-paris.fr/). I am a member of the [POEMS](https://uma.ensta-paris.fr/poems/) team, where I work with Patrick Joly and Sonia Fliss on homogenization of thin layers for Maxwell's equations.

**Research interests**

My research is motivated by the study of wave propagation problems; so far I have investigated problems drawn from:
- aeroacoustics (modeling of sound absorbing materials in the time domain)
- electromagnetism (singular surface plasmons).

Mathematically, my work centers around the analysis and discretization of deterministic partial differential equations. Here are a few keywords:

- time-domain impedance boundary conditions
- fractional operators
- time-delay systems
- discontinuous Galerkin methods
- sign-changing problems
- periodic homogenization.
